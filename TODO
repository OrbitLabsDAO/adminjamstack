SOURCE ISSUE

TODO When we commit we have the issue of the \_source file existing and having all the custom code it in to fix this we should use
a bash script called delpoy.sh the usage will be

     deploy.sh origin
     deploy.sh github   (could be a better name now)

     if origin is passed it

        runs buildintegrity.sh (we could merge it)
        moved _source to _custom
        git add
        askes for a commit message
        git commit
        asks for a branch * may not be required as it could just push the branch you are on
        git push origin **branch**
        moves the _source file back to _custom

    if github

        git add
        askes for a commit message
        git commit
        asks for a branch * may not be required as it could just push the branch you are on
        git push origin **branch**

Make it

FUTURE
MAY NOT DO THESE INCLUDES, COULD BE OVERKILL MORE THOUGHT IS REQUIRED.
includes
the way i was thinking about njk files is wrong as it would mean doing the core files, we will have to think of a better
way to do this. Maybe you just replace the whole thing and dont have includes atall

        apigenerator
            override the entire api generator file (seems dumb but some may want to do it)

        account
            dashboard.njk
            login.njk
            resetpassword.njk
            settings.njk
            verify.njk

        not sure if we should let them override this or not.



        hold completely new sections of the dashboard here.

        menu
            this will include custom menu stuff.

login test isDeleted
login test isBlocked
login test isAdmin
add nice edit inputs for edit pages
clean up account.js break it down to sepeate account file for each page
on adminuser create generate an apisecret key on insert  
add a build to prod function

INPUTS
think about look ups?
how we do required fields

how do we handle joins etc maybe look at how orms do it (the backwards way is neat)
copy across the custom assets folder (custom js etc) do we want to do this, if so how does the person dev how is this easy to do.
