put a sql file in the sql dir
run node buildit.js

table transformations

is this the best way to achieve this? how do ORMs do it?

add "as_" at the start of a filed name and it will not be shown in the add / edit pages
add "as_internal" field to any table and it will not render view, add or edit pages for this table
